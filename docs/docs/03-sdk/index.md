# SDK Overview

The Sprinter SDK provides a set of tools and functionalities to interact with the Sprinter Intent Engine. It allows developers to easily retrieve intent-based solutions, such as cross-chain balance aggregation, token transfers, and contract calls, across multiple blockchain networks.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Balance Retrieval**: Fetch user balances across multiple supported blockchains.
- **Bridging Solutions**: Generate solutions for single-hop and multi-hop token transfers across chains.
- **Contract Call Solutions**: Generate solutions to perform contract calls along with cross-chain transfers.
- **Typed Methods**: TypeScript support for all SDK methods, ensuring type safety and better developer experience.

## Use Cases

1. **Balance Aggregation**: Aggregate a user's balance for a specific token across multiple chains.
2. **Token Bridging**: Create bridging solutions to transfer tokens across different chains.
3. **Contract Interactions**: Retrieve solutions for executing contract calls while bridging tokens.

For more detailed usage and examples, please refer to the [Methods Reference](04-methods-reference.md).
