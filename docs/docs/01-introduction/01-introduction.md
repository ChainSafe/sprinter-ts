# Welcome To The Sprinter Docs

Sprinter is a **fast, smooth, interoperable intent execution engine**. Our aim is to make multichain interactions feel like one. In doing so, we enhance cross-chain UX *for all* as a first-class citizen in both existing and upcoming web3 technologies.

Sprinter provides execution for chain abstracton providers by operating a large cluster of solvers that are designed to:
- ‚öñÔ∏è simplify cross-chain balance aggregation and transaction management 
- üîÄ automatically provide optimized execution paths by determining the fastest and cheapest paths for a transfer, regardless of layer
- ü•∞ provide the ultimate UX buff to users, applications, protocols, and wallets
- ‚öôÔ∏è be unopinionated about account types (EOAs or smart contract accounts)

The Sprinter solver engine creates capital efficiency across the cross-chain transaction flow by bearing equivocation risk for users and intent providers with our solvers. In effect, this optimizes the transaction supply chain for the user since we create the destination calldata. 

Just as the explosion of the EVM L2 ecosystem has brought about horizontal scalability for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, Sprinter amplifies this effect by facilitating movement of funds between all chains.
