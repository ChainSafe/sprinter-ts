# React SDK Overview

The **Sprinter React SDK** provides a set of tools and hooks to interact with the Sprinter Intent Engine directly within React applications. It allows developers to easily manage cross-chain balance aggregation and bridging solutions using React components.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Balance Retrieval**: Fetch user balances across multiple supported blockchains.
- **Bridging Solutions**: Generate solutions for cross-chain token transfers and contract calls.
- **Contract Call Solutions**: Generate solutions to perform contract calls along with cross-chain transfers.
- **React Hooks**: Simplified and declarative access to Sprinter's core functionality through React hooks.

## Use Cases

1. **Balance Aggregation**: Aggregate a userâ€™s balance for a specific token across multiple chains.
2. **Token Bridging**: Create bridging solutions to transfer tokens across different chains.
3. **Contract Interactions**: Retrieve solutions for executing contract calls while bridging tokens.

For more detailed usage and examples, refer to the [Methods Reference](04-methods-reference/).
